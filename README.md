# Python-practice
1. Create an empty dictionary, a list of countries, a list of respective capitals, a tuple of respective currencies and 
   a set of length of name of countries
   -> creating empty dictionary
   -> creating a list with 5 countries
   -> creating a list of respective capitals of 5 countries
   -> creating a tuple of currencies of respective countries
   -> Creating a set that indicates the length of name of countries
3. Add the created list of countries, a list of respective capitals, a tuple of respective currencies and 
   a set of  length of name of countries to the empty dictionary
   -> we make the created lists to dictionary(key-value pairs)
